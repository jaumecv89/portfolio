## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before setting up the project:

- Node.js (version >= 14)
- npm (version >= 6) or yarn (version >= 1.22)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-portfolio
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

## Usage

To start the development server and run the project locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server and open the project in your default browser. Any changes you make to the source code will be automatically reloaded.

## Projects

Explore the various projects that I've worked on in the Projects section of my portfolio. Each project comes with a brief description, list of technologies used, and links to live demos or repositories.

## GraphQL and Apollo Client Integration

This portfolio integrates with the Hygraph CMS using GraphQL and Apollo Client to fetch and manage data for the list of projects and experience. This integration ensures a dynamic and efficient way to display the content on the portfolio. By using GraphQL, I can precisely query the data I need, and Apollo Client helps manage the fetched data and seamlessly integrate it into the components.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.

## Testing

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```
